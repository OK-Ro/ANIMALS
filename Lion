The lion is a species of large cat that lives in Africa and some parts of Asia. They are known for their distinctive manes, which are only found in males, and their fierce hunting abilities. Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides, which are typically made up of females, their cubs, and a few males. They are considered to be vulnerable to extinction, with their populations declining in many parts of the world due to habitat loss and hunting.
