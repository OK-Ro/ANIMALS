The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, 
is a bear native to south-central China. 
It is easily recognized by the large, 
distinctive black patches around its eyes, 
over the ears, and across its round body.
 Pandas are herbivores, eating almost exclusively bamboo, 
 and are known for their relaxed and peaceful temperament. 
 They are also an endangered species, with only around
  1,800 pandas remaining in the wild.
